## Code Quality

**Does not meet Expectations**

3 commits over 5 days?  And you didn't even look at them, so you committed 617 unwanted cache and log files (due to no .gitignore file).  Almost every line came from `rails g scaffold` or devise generators.  You started from ga-dc/project2, instead of your own repo.  You are better than this.  We both know that.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Does not meet expectations**

Signup link is hidden (link and background color are same), until the "visited" style kicks in.  "Ideas" link goes to error.  Can't create new recipe?
